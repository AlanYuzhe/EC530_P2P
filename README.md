# P2P Messaging Application

This project is a peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging application that allows users to directly communicate with each other without the need for a centralized server. The application supports both online and offline messaging, where messages can be sent to users who are not currently online and delivered once they become available.

## Features

- **Direct P2P Communication**: Enables direct messaging between clients without routing through a central server, enhancing privacy and reducing latency.
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Clients can register and discover each other dynamically, making it easier to connect without predefined IP addresses and ports.
- **Offline Messaging**: Messages sent to users who are not currently online are stored and will be attempted to be sent when the user becomes available. *(Note: This feature is currently under testing and not fully implemented.)*
